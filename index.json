[{"categories":null,"content":"Howdy, Thank you for visiting my blog. I started this blog because I wish to write my thoughts about computer science, statistics, startups, technology products and also some essays and stories. I attempted to blog many years back when i was younger. I ended up deleting my old blog. I started my journey in the technology world 15 years back when i was about 14 years old. I was hooked on to computers - and specifically programming. We had a couple of books on BASIC and FORTRAN and a computer at home. That was in mid 2000s. QBASIC was the first programming language i programmed in followed by C and Java. I built many simple console projects back then. And so, science and technology has always been my first love. Later in my career, I started my own startup in the programmatic online advertising world. I went to work with multiple technology product startups. I have a keen interest in the startup world. Currently, i am working on a couple of very exciting projects. You can reach me at adysingh1989 [at] gmail.com Thank you for reading.

We will review the Go language. I will try to introduce the reader to the fundamental concepts and spend more time trying to see what makes Go so special. First things first, if you are coming from the world of Python, Javascript or PHP - Go is a compiled and a statically typed language. It is much closer to C in that respect. Your code is compiled to raw binary which is then executed directly by the targeted CPU. Go was developed at Google and was intended to replace many shortcomings of C++ (which is by no means a bad language). We can go into great details about the debate between various programming languages. But this post is not intended to be the place for that kind of discussion. So let us jump right onto Go.
