For example, consider the following annotated function: def add(x:int, y:int) -\u003e int: return x + y The Python interpreter does not attach any semantic meaning to the attached annotations. They are not type checks, nor do they make Python behave any differently than it did before. However, they might give useful hints to others reading the source code about what you had in mind. Third-party tools and frameworks might also attach semantic meaning to the annotations. They also appear in documentation: \u003e\u003e\u003e help(add) Help on function add in module __main__: add(x: int, y: int) -\u003e int Although you can attach any kind of object to a function as an annotation (e.g., numbers, strings, instances, etc.), classes or strings often seem to make the most sense. Function annotations are merely stored in a function’s annotations attribute. For example: \u003e\u003e\u003e add.__annotations__ {'y': \u003cclass 'int'\u003e, 'return': \u003cclass 'int'\u003e, 'x': \u003cclass 'int'\u003e} Although there are many potential uses of annotations, their primary utility is probably just documentation. Because Python doesn’t have type declarations, it can often be difficult to know what you’re supposed to pass into a function if you’re simply reading its source code in isolation. An annotation gives someone more of a hint.
