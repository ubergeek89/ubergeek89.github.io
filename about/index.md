# About Me


Howdy,

I am Aditya Singh. I am a professional programmer. I started this blog because I wish to write thoughts, about computer science, statistics, startups and technology products as i learn new things.

I was introduced to the world of computers and programming when i was just 12 years old. I am a complete autodidact. I founded one startup and have held multiple jobs.

Currently, i am working on a couple of exciting projects.

You can reach me at ubergeekady [at] gmail.com.

Thank you for reading.

Aditya
