# About Me


Howdy,

Thank you for visiting my blog. I started this blog because I wish to write my thoughts about computer science, statistics, startups, technology products and also some essays and stories. I attempted to blog many years back when i was younger. I ended up deleting my old blog.

I was introduced to the world of computers and programming by my father when i was just 12 years old. Old school folks use the word "programming" rather than "coding" or "development" and so i prefer to use that. I am a big fan of [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) and he too uses the same title. My first programs were in QBASIC. I learned C and Java after that and then went on to explore many other technologies. I am a total autodidact. I founded one startup and have held multiple jobs.

Currently, i am working on a couple of very exciting projects.

You can reach me at ubergeekady [at] gmail.com.

Thank you for reading.

Aditya
